# gNMI
This repository explain how to use gNMI with a realtime database and a tool to graph that. That's will be cool and easy don't panic :)  

In my tutorial, I used containerlab x docker to containerized everything. For the database I used INFLUXDB (v1.8) for the graph I used grafana (latest) and I used gnmic (v0.34.2).

I will go in the detail for the explaination so don't be blocked by something you don't understand. Just follow the process and everything is going to be great !
